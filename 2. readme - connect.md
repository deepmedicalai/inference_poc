Use USB to Micro (use USB port on RPi, it will power it up)

Use:
```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```
Default pwd: `raspberry`


To use IP address:
```
ssh pi@172.20.10.7
```

to get IP address of raspberry PI
- install nmap: `brew install nmap` on Windows you may need to use Wireshark
- run `sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/^Nmap/{ip=$NF}/B8:27:EB/{print ip}'` where `192.168.1.0` is base of you IP address space.

## Troubleshooting

If you reflashed SD card and your laptop still remembers old association between ip and SSH key, you may receive the following message
```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:fhdjGQHSylrQtZ8zk9TFrD2oHMAL3/yoJRl8v28EPGk.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /Users/dmitry/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /Users/dmitry/.ssh/known_hosts:12
ECDSA host key for 192.168.1.201 has changed and you have requested strict checking.

```

Fix:
```
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.201

Now try to SSH again
